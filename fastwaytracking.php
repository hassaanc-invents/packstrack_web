Contact the sender: If you were supposed to receive the package, you should contact the sender and let them know it hasn't arrived. They might be able to give you more information or file a claim on your behalf with the courier or carrier.
Start a claim: If you can't find your package or get the courier or carrier to fix the problem, you may need to start a claim for the lost or missing package. Most of the time, this means filling out a form and showing proof of the value and contents of the package. The courier or shipping company should be able to tell you more about how to file a claim."
